### **Superstore Sales Analysis – Excel Dashboard**



##### **Why I built this**

I created this project to practice turning raw sales data into meaningful business insights using Excel. Instead of focusing only on numbers, I wanted to understand who the customers are, where sales are coming from, and which channels perform best.



##### **What this dashboard shows**



* Monthly trend of Orders vs Sales to understand seasonality
* Men vs Women contribution to total sales
* Age group vs Gender buying patterns
* Top 10 states contributing to revenue
* Order status analysis to track delivery efficiency
* Online sales channel performance (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Ajio, Meesho)

##### 

##### **Tools \& Skills Used**



* Microsoft Excel
* Pivot Tables \& Pivot Charts
* Slicers for dashboard interactivity
* Data cleaning and structuring
* Business analysis and data storytelling





##### **Key Insights**

* Women customers contribute a higher share of total sales
* Amazon and Myntra are the strongest sales channels
* Most orders are successfully delivered, with very low return and refund rates
* A few states consistently drive the majority of revenue



##### **What I learned**



* Learned how to transform raw transactional data into structured insights
* Improved my ability to ask the right business questions from data
* Gained confidence in Excel dashboard design and analytical thinking
* Understood how customer demographics and sales channels impact revenue



This project helped me strengthen my Excel analytics, dashboard design, and data storytelling skills.
